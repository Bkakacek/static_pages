Country Music Origins
=====================

Country music is a popular type of music that originated in the south
in 1920. It has roots and ties to classical blues, folk, as well as some forms
of rock music. In 1940 country rose to popularity as a southern american pheonom. This rise was becuase
of the rise of the radio as a source for entertainment. The grand ole opry, is 
one thing that was formed in 1940 that helped country music popularity rise.
Bristol, Tennessee is known as the birthplace of Country music. A couple of miles away in the same
state, the country music capital of the world is Nashville Tennessee. 
Nashville is one of the most famous cities in America because of its huge ties to country music.
Country music also grew into many seperate genres through the years. After traditional country western
music originated in the 1940's, it grew into genres such as rockabilly, which is a form of country that
features dance like country that can be found in honky tonks and dance clubs. There are also other
forms such as country pop which featured the likes of Dolly parton and John Denver. Country music's
origins can originally be traced back to the south, specifically in Tennesee. When it started,
it was a cross between blues and folk music, but it has grown so much throughout time to become
the marketable empire that it is today.
