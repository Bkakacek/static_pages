Jazz Origins
===============

Jazz has a deep and rich history, originating in the early 20th century.It started in New Orleans, Louisiana where there was an enourmous multitude of people from all around the world. A combination of European classical music, American blues and South American rhythms blended together to form what is now know as Jazz.

By the 1910, Jazz music had started to gain popularity. The Original Dixieland Jazz Band created what is considered the first jazz album in 1917. The band was a group of five musicians that played in the Papa Jack Laine bands and were a diverse group of musicians. Their success in recording music was the inspiration for the creation of many other Jazz bands.
