Hip Hop as a genre for better or for worse has had a major impact on the 
music industry and American culture as a whole. Hip Hop is an uplifting genre 
meant to bring a voice to the people who feel like they have none. The major 
opponents of hip hop believe the music is aggressive and has a rebellious 
behavior. Whether this genre is negative or not, the genre is a platform and 
vocal outlet for people in America. It has allowed rappers to express their 
thoughts and opinions on the current state of society. Hip-Hop represents 
marginalized groups who have been taken advantage of by the government. 

Hip-Hop in the 20th Century

Hip-Hop during the nineties greatly evolved and acted in direct retaliation 
against the socio-economic issues of the time, which impacted social culture 
and social changes in American history. Hip-Hop allowed marginalized groups to 
fight injustices against them through music as a form of protest.  Hip-Hop in 
the nineties marked a national movement to uplift people across the nation, 
which holds major social and cultural significance. Hip Hop acted as a voice for 
many marginalized Americans, which built up the ideals and identities of entire 
communities. In fact, many of the MCâ€™s in the nineties like Tupac and Snoop Dogg 
represented the voices of an entire generation.
