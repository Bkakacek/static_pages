Hip-Hop Origins
===============

	The origins of rock and roll has been debated by historian’s music, but generally, most
would agree that it started in the Southern United States. Rock and Rolls start came from the
rhythm and blues, or R&B music, and country music of the 1940s and 1950s. During and
immediately after World War 2, with shortages of fuel and limitations on audience and
personnel, large jazz bands were uneconomical and were replaced by smaller combos using
guitars, bass, and drums.

	Chuck Berry, commonly regarded as one of the founders of rock and roll, developed his
brand by transposing the familiar two-note lead line of jump blues piano directly to the electric
guitar, creating what is instantly recognizable as rock guitar. Then, inspired electric blues, Chuck
Berry introduced an aggressive guitar sound to rock and roll, and established the electric guitar
as its centerpiece, adapting his rock band instrumentation of a lead guitar, second chord
instrument, bass, and drums. Rock and roll arrived at a time of technological change, after the
development of the electric guitar, amplifier, microphone, and 45 rpm record.

	Rock and roll, being a predominately “black” music, it was taboo on many white-owned
radio outlets, but artists and producers quickly recognized the potential of rock and roll. Some
of Elvis Presley’s early recordings were covers of black rhythm and blues or blues songs.
Songwriting credits were often unreliable, and many publishers, record executives, and even
managers would insert their name as the composer in order to collect royalty checks.
