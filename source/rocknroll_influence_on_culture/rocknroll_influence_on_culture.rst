Influence on Culture
====================

	Rock and roll influenced lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language. It may have
contributed to the civil rights movement because both African-American and white American
teens enjoyed the music. The lyrics of rock and roll songs described events and conflicts that
most listeners would be able to relate to with personal experience. Topics like sex that hadn’t
normally appeared in songs began to appear in rock and roll lyrics. This new music aimed to
break boundaries and express emotions that people were feeling but didn’t talk about.

	In the crossover of African-American “race music” to a growing white youth audience,
the growth of rock and roll included both black performers reaching a white audience and
white musicians performing African-American music. Rock and roll appeared at a time when
racial tensions in the United States were entering a new stage, with the beginning of the civil
rights movement for ending segregation. Many authors have argued that early rock and roll
was a key part in the way both black and white teenagers identified themselves.

	Several rock historians have claimed that rock and roll was the first music genre that
defined an age group. It gave teenagers who were feeling alone a sense of belonging. Rock and
roll is often identified with teen culture of the first baby boomer generation, who had more
leisure time and had rock and roll become a subculture. This involved not just music, but
extended to TV programs, clothes, film, hair, cars, and distinctive language.
